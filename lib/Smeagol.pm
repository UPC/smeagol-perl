=head1 NAME

Smeagol - A resource and booking management tool for the greedy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The L<Universitat PolitE<egrave>cnica de Catalunya|http://www.upc.edu/>
is a large educational organization divided into lots of smaller and
independent units. Each unit deals with its own resources making
usually quite difficult to share them with other units. Plus, each unit
spents many resources in solving the same problems than the other units.
Therefore, the purpose of this project is to establish the grounds
to share resources and feed from the common knowlege available on these
units while trying to find a distributed solution to this particular
problem, the resource and booking management for large organizations.
